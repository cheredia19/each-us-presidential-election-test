## 1789 | George Washington's first unanimous choice

The first in history. The 1789 presidential election took place following the [ratification of the United States Constitution on June 21, the year before](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-day-the-constitution-was-ratified). 

**George Washington**, who essentially ran unopposed due to his immense popularity, was elected for the first of his two terms as President of the United States. Each of the 69 electors was expected to cast two ballots. All voted for Washington, making him the unanimous choice as the first president. John Adams became the first Vice President.

Before this election, the country had no chief executive. Under the previous system (the [Articles of Confederation](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/articles-of-confederation)) the national government was headed by the Confederation Congress, which had a ceremonial presiding officer and several executive departments, but no independent executive branch.

## 1792 | George Washington's second unanimous choice

The presidential election of 1792 was the second in the United States history and the first in which each of the original 13 states appointed electors (in addition to newly added Kentucky and Vermont). 

It is also the only presidential election that was not held four years after the previous election.

**George Washington** was, just like in 1789, the unanimous selection of all 132 presidential electors. Partisan politics had grown sharply during his first administration, but there was little interest among his ideological opponents in opposing his reelection.

## 1796 | John Adams (F) v. Thomas Jefferson (DR)

A worn-out George Washington refused to consider a third term. He supported his Vice President, **John Adams**. Thomas Pinckney, Samuel Adams, Oliver Ellsworth, and John Jay also participated in the Federalist ticket.

Their opponents were former Secretary of State **Thomas Jefferson** and Senator Aaron Burr on the Democratic-Republican side. At this point, each man from any party ran alone, as the formal position of *running mate* had not yet been established.

Unlike the previous election where the outcome had been a foregone conclusion, Democratic-Republicans campaigned heavily for Jefferson, and Federalists did the same for Adams. 

The debate was outrageous, with Federalists tying the Democratic-Republicans to the violence of the French Revolution and the Democratic-Republicans accusing the Federalists of favoring monarchism and aristocracy. 

In foreign policy, the Democratic-Republicans denounced the Federalists over [Jay's Treaty](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1784-1800/jay-treaty), perceived as too favorable to Britain. The French ambassador embarrassed the Democratic-Republicans by publicly backing them and attacking the Federalists right before the election.

The Constitution in 1796 required presidential electors to place the names of two individuals on their ballots; the candidate with the highest vote count, if a majority, became the president and the runner-up the vice president. 

Federalist John Adams earned 71 votes from the Electoral College and became the second U.S. elected president in history, while Jefferson achieved 68 electoral votes and became Vice President. It was the only election that saw a President and Vice President from opposing tickets.
