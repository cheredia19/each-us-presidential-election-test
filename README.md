## 1796

### Popular and electoral votes by candidate

A worn-out George Washington refused to consider a third term. He supported his Vice President, **John Adams**.

Their opponents were former Secretary of State **Thomas Jefferson** and Senator Aaron Burr on the Democratic-Republican ticket. At this point, each man from any party ran alone, as the formal position of *running mate* had not yet been established.

The Constitution in 1796 required presidential electors to place the names of two individuals on their ballots; the candidate with the highest vote count, if a majority, became the president and the runner-up the vice president.Â 

Federalist John Adams earned 71 votes from the Electoral College and became the second U.S. elected president in history. Jefferson, a Democratic-Republican, achieved 68 electoral votes and became Vice President. It was the only election that saw a President and Vice President from opposing tickets.
